Well first of all thank you for downloading this bot / using this bot. 

As you see you need to ranks to use this bot, you can change the names of the bot in the code as well. 
I used the 'NonV' and the 'Verified'. 

If you don't change the ranknames you need those specific ranks. You also need a channel name for the players where they can verify
I used the channel name 'verify'. You could make it so only the players with the NonV rank can see that channel cause the rank will 
get deleted once they verified correctly. 

If you have any further questions please contact me. My discord is in the sourcecode. 
Also use this code if you didn't download Discord.JS already.

npm install --save discord.js
